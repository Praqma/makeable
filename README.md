# makeable

POC for makeable
This script starts a PHP and mysql in Docker and links them.
It then pulls a repository specified in the docker-compose yml file.

Right now you can access http://localhost:80 and http://localhost:80/testmysql.php
It pulls the repository : https://github.com/Praqma/makeable-code

# To run:

./install.sh
